      "description": "Song-myeon was a victim of workplace negligence, just one of many workers in South Korea during this era who lost their lives in industrial accidents and to workplace-related illnesses. When he was initially employed by Hyupsung Gyegong, a thermometer manufacturing company, in December 1987, Song-myeon was a healthy teenage boy; originally from a poor farming family in Seosan-gun, South Chungcheong Province, he left his rural hometown to attend classes at Yeongdeungpo Technical High School in Seoul. He was living with his older brother, Geun-myeon, and was determined to find a job in the bustling city. Song-myeon signed on with the thermometer company, where he was given the job of injecting mercury into thermometers.",

      "description": "Victim of the Seongsu bridge collapse. It was the 21st of October, 1994, when a part of the Seongsu bridge in Seoul, connecting the districts of Gangnam and Seongdong, suddenly collapsed. In total 6 vehicles fell down with it, including 1 van, 1 bus, and 4 cars. The accident resulted in 32 deaths, most of them being the passengers of the bus, which crashed upside down. The accident caused South Korea to look more into the durability of their structures, and many bridges went under repair just days after, to avoid accidents like this in the future.",

      "description": "Moon Jiseong was born on February 6, 1998. She was a member of the 10th grade class #1 at Danwon High School in Ansan, South Korea. She lived for 16 years, 2 months and 10 days. Jiseong was the fourth child in her family. She was a pretty, confident, generous, caring girl who always wanted the best for everyone around her. Her dream was to be an airline stewardess, and she was attending English school so she could master the language in order to fulfill her dream. Jiseong was a victim of the Sewol Ferry tragedy. The ferry Sewol was en route to Jeju Island from Incheon, South Korea, when it capsized on April 16, 2014. The majority of the 476 people on board were 10th graders from Danwon High School who were traveling to Jeju Island for a school field trip. When the ship started to sink, the crew ordered everyone to stay in their cabins and await help. Jiseong and most of the Danwon students on board obeyed the crew and remained in their cabins, passing the time by taking pictures and joking around with their friends. However, the coast guard only rescued those who'd come out on deck and didn't even attempt to rescue anyone inside the ship. The Korean government, ashamed at how the event unfolded, blocked volunteer rescuers and made excuses as to why rescue efforts could not continue. By the time they started recovery efforts, they were only finding bodies. There were hundreds of high schoolers, teachers and other passengers inside the ship and not a single one of them survived. The majority of them were still alive during the three hours it took for the Sewol to sink, recording videos of their ordeal and banging on the windows, begging to be saved - but they all eventually drowned or died of hypothermia. Those kids had trusted adults with their lives and were literally left to die. 304 people died in total, with 250 of them being Danwon High School students. The Sewol Ferry sinking was one of the most heartbreaking and senseless maritime tragedies to have ever happened. The students’ loved ones are still looking for answers as to why those 250 beautiful children had to die… and those answers may never come. Jiseong's body was recovered and returned to her loving family on April 30. She is now resting at the Hwaseong Sky Memorial Park.",

The collapse killed 502 people and injured 937, making it the largest peacetime disaster in South Korean history. It was the deadliest non-deliberate modern building collapse until the 2013 Dhaka garment factory collapse in Bangladesh. Construction on the building commenced in 1987 and was completed in 1990. The company initially contracted to build the structure withdrew after the chairman of Sampoong Group's construction division, Lee Joon, demanded changes to the concrete support columns that introduced structural concerns. Joon ultimately used his own company to complete construction. Investigators blamed the collapse primarily on the column specifications which were incorrect for a flat-slab building design. Joon was found guilty of criminal negligence and sentenced to 10.5 years in prison.",
